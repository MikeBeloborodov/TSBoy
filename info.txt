The program counter is the address of the next opcode in memory to execute. 
Some opcodes require the next one or two bytes in memory to use as arguments. 
When this is the case the program counter needs to skip these to point to the next actual opcode.

The program counter is initialized to 0x100

The stack pointer points to the very top of the stack in memory, 
in other words the area of memory where the next piece of data to be added to the stack would occupy. 
Like the program counter the stack pointer points to address is memory so a WORD data type would also represent the stack pointer well. 
However some of the opcodes use the hi and lo bytes of the stack pointer so it would be easier to emulate the stack pointer the 
same way we do the registers. 

The stack pointer is initialized to 0xFFFE.
